IPL Analysis: A Data Visualization Project in Tableau:

This project brings the comprehensive IPL analysis to life through a series of interactive and insightful dashboards in Tableau. My goal was to transform raw, historical data into a visually compelling and user-friendly experience that reveals hidden patterns and actionable insights about the game.

Executive Summary Dashboard: A high-level overview of key IPL statistics, including overall run trends, wicket distribution, and toss decision impact.

Player Performance Deep Dive: Interactive charts and filters allow users to analyze and compare the performance of individual players. I've included visualizations for:

Batting: Strike Rate, Average, and Boundary Hitting

Bowling: Economy Rate, Wickets, and Bowling Average

Team vs. Team Analysis: A dynamic dashboard that allows users to select two teams and compare their head-to-head performance across all seasons.

Venue Insights: Explored how different stadiums influence match outcomes, including first-innings scores and win percentages for teams batting first.

Technical Skills Demonstrated:

Data Preparation: Used Tableau Prep (or similar tools) to clean, shape, and join multiple datasets (e.g., ball-by-ball, match info) for a unified analysis.

Advanced Visualizations: Created custom charts such as a "Wagon Wheel" for batsmen and a "Pitch Map" for bowlers to showcase detailed performance metrics.

Calculated Fields & Parameters: Built complex calculations to derive metrics like "run rate in the last 5 overs" and used parameters for dynamic filtering and "what-if" analysis.

Dashboard Actions: Implemented filter, highlight, and URL actions to create a seamless, drill-down user experience.
