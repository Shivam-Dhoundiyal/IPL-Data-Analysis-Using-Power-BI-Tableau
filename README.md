### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Skills Demonstrated

This project showcases a range of data visualization and analytics skills:

* **Data Preparation & Integration:**
    * Cleaned, shaped, and joined multiple complex datasets (ball-by-ball, match info) using Tableau Prep for a unified and robust data source.

* **Advanced Visualizations:**
    * Created custom and non-native charts like the **Wagon Wheel** for batsmen's scoring areas and a **Pitch Map** for bowlers' line and length analysis to provide deeper performance context.
